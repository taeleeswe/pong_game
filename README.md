This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle module.

## Description

The game consists of two paddles and a ball. The objective is to bounce the ball past the opponent's paddle to score points. The paddles are controlled by the players using keyboard inputs.

2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `main.py` file using Python:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
5. Use the following controls to play:
    - Right paddle (Player 1): Up arrow key to move up, Down arrow key to move down.
    - Left paddle (Player 2): 'w' key to move up, 's' key to move down.
6. The game ends when one player reaches the score limit.

## Features
